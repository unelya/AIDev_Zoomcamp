# Snake React

This is a Vite + React implementation of the classic Snake game. Use the arrow keys to steer the snake, collect food, and try not to collide with yourself.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If npm cannot reach the registry from your Codespace, re-run the session with network access enabled or download the dependencies locally and copy them in.

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite dev server
- `npm run build` – create a production build inside `dist`
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint on the project

## Gameplay controls

- **Arrow keys** steer the snake. The game begins automatically when you press an arrow key.
- **Start / Pause** toggles the running state. After a game over, the button becomes **Restart**.
- **Reset** clears score and state.
- **Speed** selector changes tick speed before starting/resuming the snake.
